     *     Notes:
     *       - Redirections are only followed if the CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION option is set to true.
     *       - According to the HTTP specs (see [1]), a 303 redirection should be followed using
     *         the GET method. 301 and 302 must not.
     *       - In order to force a 303 redirection to be performed using the same method, the
     *         underlying cURL object must be set in a special state (the CURLOPT_CURSTOMREQUEST
     *         option must be set to the method to use after the redirection). Due to a limitation
     *         of the cURL extension of PHP < 5.5.11 ([2], [3]) and of HHVM, it is not possible
     *         to reset this option. Using these PHP engines, it is therefore impossible to
     *         restore this behavior on an existing php-curl-class Curl object.
